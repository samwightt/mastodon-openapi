# mastodon-openapi

An [OpenAPI definition](https://www.openapis.org/) for [Mastodon's REST API](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/api/).

## Why?

OpenAPI definitions can be used to generate client libraries for APIs with proper type safety. [There's been an issue open for quite a while to create an OpenAPI spec](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/1404), but not much work has been done on it.

This project aims to provide a simple API definition made by hand and based off the docs on the website. We're using [Stoplight Studio](https://stoplight.io/studio) to do editing and validation.

To contribute, just clone the repository locally and open the folder in Stoplight Studio. Feel free to modify the file from there and make pull requests as necessary.
